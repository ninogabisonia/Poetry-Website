    <h2>What exactly is Poetry?</h2>
    <p>
        A POEM IS  LANGUAGE STRUCTURED THROUGH THE REPETITION OF ANY LANGUAGE ELEMENT
        <br>

        The language element that repeats can be anything. It can be a rhyme sound or a pattern of accents and syllables. It can be a repeating word or phrase or refrain. It can be a dictionary game (like the Oulipo game S+7)  or an erasure technique.  It can be a line break (which makes the poem free verse) or simply a hiatus or ending (which makes the poem a prose poem--in this case the ending only repeats once, but we still recognize it as a pattern).
        
        Two things need to be emphasized to fully understand this definition:
        
        Structure is different from decoration. Structure is pattern that can be predicted, and we feel that something is broken if it changes.  Decoration can't be predicted, and if it changes we won't feel anything is broken. A novel can use a lot of words that begin with "s" in certain passages, but we won't expect the pattern to continue or notice if it's broken. But if a piece of language uses "s" to begin every third word throughout the whole text, we will respond to the text like a poem--we will enter a holistic, physical interaction with the text (I think of it as a magical interaction), and our bodies will notice if the pattern is broken. That is structural repetition. If a free verse poem suddenly stops breaking lines and turns into a paragraph of right-justified text, we will notice that the structure of breaking lines has broken. If someone recites "Roses Are red, Violets are blue" aloud, but replaces the word "you" with "we" in line 4, someone hearing the poem will understand that the structural pattern of rhyme has been broken.  We expect that it will happen at a certain point, and if it's left off, we will feel as if something's wrong and needs to be fixed. Poets can play with these expectations, and it can be fun to a point, but it needs to be done carefully because if the pattern is completely abandoned, we will no longer experience poetry-magic: the free verse with no linebreaks will become prose.  For a contrast between structural and decorative sound effects, read "The Night Before Christmas" aloud but replace "long winter's nap" in line 7 with "long winter's sleep." You will see the rhyme is structural. On the other hand, if you read the poem aloud and replace the word "snug" with "tight" in line 5, nobody will notice (unless they already know the poem by heart).  The consonance of the s's between "nestled" and "snug" is a skillful and satisfying sound-effect, but it is merely decorative, not structural. We can't predict it in advance, and we won't notice if it's gone. A poem may repeat numerous decorative elements of language, but so can a passage of prose.  It is only the repetition of structural elements that make a poem a poem.2.  Lyric is different from poetry.  Lyrical language expresses feelings and emotions A lot of poetry is lyrical, but there are other kinds of poetry too--narrative poetry that tells a story, dramatic poetry that enacts a play,  mnemonic poetry that helps us remember things. etc. So, if you think this definition is a cold, sad one that is missing the real point of poetry--connecting with feelings--then you are probably confusing poetry with lyric.  Poetry is very good at lyric, but it's not the only thing poetry does; and prose can be very lyrical too! (think of your favorite love letters). Emotional power and linguistic freshness, along with all the other qualities we usually think of as "poetic," could occur just as easily in prose (imagine, for example, a lyrical passage of prose such as the end of Joyce's Ulysses).  Eloquence, concision, rhythm, musical patterns of consonants and vowels, carefully chosen diction, an emotionally moving tone, metaphors, similes, "the best words in the best order"—all these can be just as evident in lyrical prose as in lyrical poetry. Furthermore, we can easily imagine a text that anyone would agree is a poem that has absolutely none of these qualities. So the truth is that none of these elements defines poetry. Even repeating elements such as extreme rhythmicality, rhetorical repetition, and high amounts of word music don't necessarily make a text a poem—as long as we can't predict when they will occur.  It is only when the repetition is structural that we have a poem.

<h1>Sylvia Plath</h1>
<img src="images/sylviaplath.jpg" alt="">

<p>1932–1963 <br>
    Sylvia Plath was one of the most dynamic and admired poets of the 20th century. By the time she took her life at the age of 30, Plath already had a following in the literary community. In the ensuing years her work attracted the attention of a multitude of readers, who saw in her singular verse an attempt to catalogue despair, violent emotion, and obsession with death. In the New York Times Book Review, Joyce Carol Oates described Plath as “one of the most celebrated and controversial of postwar poets writing in English.” Intensely autobiographical, Plath’s poems explore her own mental anguish, her troubled marriage to fellow poet Ted Hughes, her unresolved conflicts with her parents, and her own vision of herself. On the World Socialist web site, Margaret Rees observed, “Whether Plath wrote about nature, or about the social restrictions on individuals, she stripped away the polite veneer. She let her writing express elemental forces and primeval fears. In doing so, she laid bare the contradictions that tore apart appearance and hinted at some of the tensions hovering just beneath the surface of the American way of life in the post war period.” Oates put it more simply when she wrote that Plath’s best-known poems, “many of them written during the final, turbulent weeks of her life, read as if they’ve been chiseled, with a fine surgical instrument, out of arctic ice.” Plath has inspired countless readers and influenced many poets since her death in 1963.</p>

<h2>Being a "Woman Poet"</h2>
<p> 
    Why did I pursue this idea of being a poet? A woman poet? What is a poet? What is a woman? Both of those words (Woman. Poet.) invoke different ideals and meanings – it depends on who you ask, on who asks the question.

    I read a tweet recently that said (I am paraphrasing) you can’t gender label yourself ‘woman’ unless you embody the characteristic of always caring for someone else before yourself. The person tweeting was making the point that woman are generally socialised in this way. Is this what characterises a woman?
    
    The answer is an emphatic no. By defining women (or men) in a particular way is to box them in. This leads to generalised simplistic thinking: if you are a women you must love shopping and spa treatments and the colour pink. (I am not arguing that there are not feminine or masculine ways of being – but these are rooted in energies and are NOT gender specific).
    
    Our definition of what it means to be a woman is rooted in a patriarchy that doesn’t believe women’s voices, women’s bodies and women’s issues are topics that are important in serious literature. Look at the backlash that occurred when Sarah Howe won the TS Eliot prize in 2015 and the furore that the publication of a poem titled ‘Breasts’ (Kutti Revathi) created in Tamil in 2010.
    
    There are many woman writers who define themselves by their craft of writing only and have eschewed the label of woman writer. They want to be seen as a writer only. Many women have published as men – George Eliot and the Bronte sisters are examples of this – so that their work will be taken seriously. Many women writers choose to publish under genderless names or use initials only.
    
    Why then do I claim the title of women writer? Or more specifically woman poet?
